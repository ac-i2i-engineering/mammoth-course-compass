def fetch_rss():
    """
    Fetch the RSS feed and save it as an XML file.

    This function retrieves the RSS feed from The Hub (`https://thehub.amherst.edu/events.rss`),
    and then saves the raw content of the response as an XML file. The filename is timestamped based 
    on the current date and time, and the file is stored in the `rss_files` directory.

    The function uses the `requests` library to fetch the data and saves it in binary format.

    Returns:
        None

    Examples
    --------
    >>> fetch_rss()
        # This will fetch the RSS feed and save it as a timestamped XML file.
